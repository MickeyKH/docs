# Searching your data

Aleph stores vast numbers of [documents](https://docs.alephdata.org/guide/the-basics#documents), [entities](https://docs.alephdata.org/guide/the-basics#entities), and the relationships between entities across many [datasets](https://docs.alephdata.org/guide/the-basics#datasets). Here we'll explore how to narrow down or expand your search to methodically try and find the answers to your questions or just stumble on an interesting lead using Aleph's advanced set of search operators.
