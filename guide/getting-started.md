# Getting started

With Aleph, organisations can put all kinds of data - from a procurement dataset to a leaked trove of emails - into a single place. This documentation helps people who want to search, upload or navigate data on Aleph.

Part of the Aleph toolkit is also VIS Desktop, a tool to sketch out networks of companies, people and their relationships on your own computer.
