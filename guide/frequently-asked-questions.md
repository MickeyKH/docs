# Frequently Asked Questions

If you are a looking for technical information, also check the [technical FAQ](../developers/technical-faq/).

## What is a "Legal Entity"?

It's either a company, organisation or person. The term **legal entities** are used when we don't know for sure.

Aleph is often used to search public data, such as companies registries or procurement datasets. Some of these datasets mention directors or suppliers but do not specify whether the given entity is a person, company or even a public body. Since this distinction is sometimes hard to derive from a name alone, we use **legal entity** as a stand-in.

## Does Aleph do entity extraction?

Yes. Loads. [It's nerdy](../developers/technical-faq/#how-does-aleph-extract-named-entities-from-text).

## Does Aleph have hotkeys / keyboard shortcuts?

Yes. Press the '?' key to see all available hotkeys for the current context.
